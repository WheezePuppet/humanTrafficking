humanTrafficking
================

A simulation of global human trafficking phenomenon, in particular forced
prostitution.


To compile, javac all source files. Make sure your CLASSPATH includes the
src directory (in which the humantrafficking directory resides).

You will also need to include the following in your CLASSPATH:
    - mason.16.jar, available inside the .zip file here:
      http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/mason16.zip
    - geomason1.5.jar, available here:
      http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/extensions/geomason/geomason.1.5.jar
    - jts-1.13.jar, available inside the .zip file here:
      http://sourceforge.net/projects/jts-topo-suite/files/latest/download

To run, either:
    java humantrafficking.HumanTrafficking        (for text output)
    java humantrafficking.HumanTraffickingWithUI  (for GUI)
